> Using the extended guidelines, we create a new tweet treebank for English (TWEEBANK V2)
----------------------
>WEEBANK V2 is built on the original data of TWEEBANK V1 (840 unique tweets, 639/201 for training/test), 
along with an additional 210 tweets sampled from the POS-tagged dataset of Gimpel et al. (2011) 
and 2,500 tweets sampled from the Twitter stream from February 2016 to July 2016.
The latter data source consists of 147.4M English tweets after being filtered by 
the lang attribute in the tweet JSON and langid.py.10 As done by Kong et al. (2014), 
the annotation unit is always the tweet in its entirety—which may consist of multiple 
sentences—not the sentence alone. Before annotation, we use a simple regular expression 
to anonymize usernames and URLs
