little
somethin'
for
my
godson
elijah

and
a
little
girl
named
corinne

some
say
the
blacker
the
berry
,
the
sweeter
the
juice

i
say
the
darker
the
flesh
then
the
deeper
the
roots

i
give
a
holla
to
my
sisters
on
welfare

2pac
cares
,
if
don't
nobody
else
care

and
,
i
know
they
like
to
beat
you
down
a
lot

when
you
come
around
the
block
,
brothers
clown
a
lot

but
please
don't
cry
,
dry
your
eyes
,
never
let
up

forgive
but
don't
forget
,
girl
,
keep
your
head
up

and
when
he
tells
you
you
ain't
nothin'
,
don't
believe
him

and
if
he
can't
learn
to
love
you
,
you
should
leave
him

cause
sister
,
you
don't
need
him

and
i
ain't
tryin'
to
gas
ya
up
,
i
just
call
'em
how
i
see
'em

you
know
what
makes
me
unhappy

when
brothers
make
babies
,
and
leave
a
young
mother
to
be
a
pappy

and
since
we
all
came
from
a
woman

got
our
name
from
a
woman
and
our
game
from
a
woman

i
wonder
why
we
take
from
our
women

why
we
rape
our
women
,
do
we
hate
our
women

i
think
it's
time
to
kill
for
our
women

time
to
heal
our
women
,
be
real
to
our
women

and
if
we
don't
we'll
have
a
race
of
babies

that
will
hate
the
ladies
that
make
the
babies

and
since
a
man
can't
make
one

he
has
no
right
to
tell
a
woman
when
and
where
to
create
one

so
will
the
real
men
get
up

i
know
you're
fed
up
ladies
,
but
keep
your
head
up

keep
ya
head
up
,
ooh
,
child
,
things
are
gonna
get
easier

keep
ya
head
up
,
ooh
,
child
,
things'll
get
brighter

aiyyo
,
i
remember
marvin
gaye
used
to
sing
to
me

he
had
me
feelin'
like
black
was
the
thing
to
be

and
suddenly
the
ghetto
didn't
seem
so
tough

and
though
we
had
it
rough
,
we
always
had
enough

i
huffed
and
puffed
about
my
curfew
and
broke
the
rules

ran
with
the
local
crew
and
had
a
smoke
or
two

and
i
realize
momma
really
paid
the
price

she
nearly
gave
her
life
to
raise
me
right

and
all
i
had
to
give
her
was
my
pipe
dream

of
how
i'd
rock
the
mic
and
make
it
to
the
bright
screen

i'm
tryin'
to
make
a
dollar
out
of
fifteen
cents

it's
hard
to
be
legit
and
still
pay
the
rent

and
in
the
end
it
seems
i'm
headin'
for
the
pen

i
try
to
find
my
friends
but
they're
blowin'
in
the
wind

last
night
my
buddy
lost
his
whole
family

it's
gonna
take
the
man
in
me
to
conquer
this
insanity

it
seems
the
rain'll
never
let
up

i
try
to
keep
my
head
up
and
still
keep
from
gettin'
wet
up

you
know
it's
funny
when
it
rains
it
pours

they
got
money
for
wars
but
can't
feed
the
poor

say
there
ain't
no
hope
for
the
youth
and
the
truth
is

it
ain't
no
hope
for
the
future

and
then
they
wonder
why
we
crazy

i
blame
my
mother
for
turning
my
brother
into
a
crack
baby

we
ain't
meant
to
survive
cause
it's
a
setup

and
even
though
you're
fed
up

huh
,
ya
got
to
keep
your
head
up

and
uh
,
to
all
the
ladies
havin'
babies
on
they
own

i
know
it's
kinda
rough
and
you're
feelin'
all
alone

daddy's
long
gone
and
he
left
you
by
your
lonesome

thank
the
lord
for
my
kids
,
even
if
nobody
else
want
'em

cause
i
think
we
can
make
it
,
in
fact
,
i'm
sure

and
if
you
fall
,
stand
tall
and
come
back
for
more

cause
ain't
nothin'
worse
than
when
your
son

wants
to
know
why
his
daddy
don't
love
him
no
mo'

you
can't
complain
you
was
dealt
this

hell
of
a
hand
without
a
man
,
feelin'
helpless

because
there's
too
many
things
for
you
to
deal
with

dyin'
inside
,

fearless

while

is
rollin'
down
your
cheeks

ya
steady
hopin'

,
you
couldn't
take
it
,
and
don't
blame
