About

a
good
decision

I
wish
I
could
text/call
anyone
but
tmobile
is
fucking
queer

Simple
concept
:
If
the
bottle
is
empty
,
throw
it
away
.

I
wan
na
go
home

On

I

that
was
the
best
day
booze
all

That
's
why
it
was
a
MUST
that
I
got
a
Pepsi
before
this
class
.

A
sexy
girl
pulls

Life
is
n't
fair
sometimes
.

I
do
n't
want
to
be
home
.
:
/
I
really
do
n't
wan
na

Well
.
7
days
till
game
time
.
I
'm
safe
to
say
that
it
's
on
..

I
'm
overslept
right
now
.
Like
.
Damn
.
I
usually
get
like
4
hours
of
sleep
.

When
people
pick
their
nose
around
me
I
want
to
scream
and
run
away
hysterically
.

Anddddd
,
I
ca
n't
seem
find
permanent
happiness
.
It
's
always
temporary
.

It
feels
like
a
lightning
bolt
just
hit
the
tip
of
my
penis

You
do
n't
have
to
keep
on
smiling
that
smile
that
's
driving
me
wild

I
want
a
love
like
